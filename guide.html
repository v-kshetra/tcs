  <section id="preparation">
    <h2>How to Prepare for TCS NQT 2025</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Understand the Exam Pattern:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the sections, types of questions, and time limits.</li>
      <li><strong>Identify and List Topics:</strong> Make a list of topics for each section.</li>
      <li><strong>Create a Timetable:</strong> Allocate time for each section, focusing on weak areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Prioritize Important Topics:</strong> Focus on high-weightage or challenging topics.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice Daily Coding:</strong> Solve at least 5 coding problems daily.</li>
      <li><strong>Take Mock Tests:</strong> Simulate exam conditions to improve speed and accuracy.</li>
      <li><strong>Solve Previous Year Questions (PYQ):</strong> Familiarize yourself with question types and difficulty levels.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="exam-rules">
    <h2>TCS NQT 2025 Exam Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose Questions Strategically:</strong> Spend the first two minutes of each section assessing the difficulty level of the questions. Begin with the easier ones to secure quick points before moving on to more complex problems. This approach ensures better time management and a higher overall score.</li>

        <li><strong>Fixed Section Order:</strong> Once a section starts, you must complete it before moving to the next. For example, you will have 25 minutes for Numerical Ability, 20 minutes for Verbal Ability, and 25 minutes for Logical Reasoning. Advanced sections follow the same rule. While you can navigate freely within a section, returning to a completed section is not allowed.</li>

        <li><strong>No Penalty for Wrong Answers:</strong> Since incorrect answers do not lead to negative marking, make sure to attempt all questions. Aim for accuracy, but if time is running out, guessing is better than leaving questions unanswered. You won’t lose points for incorrect responses, so take advantage of this rule.</li>

        <li><strong>Unlimited Rough Sheets:</strong> You will receive as many rough sheets as needed, so use them freely for calculations and quick notes. Don’t hesitate to use them, as they can help you organize your thoughts and solve problems efficiently.</li>

        <li><strong>Pre-Exam Note-Taking:</strong> You will get rough paper a few minutes before the test starts. Utilize this time to jot down important formulas, shortcut techniques, or key concepts that might help during the exam.</li>

        <li><strong>Built-in Calculator:</strong> The test provides an on-screen calculator, eliminating the need for an external device. Use it for complex calculations, but for simpler ones, rely on mental math or rough paper to save time.</li>

        <li><strong>Time Management for Questions:</strong> There is no timer per question, allowing you to allocate time as needed within a section. Avoid spending too much time on a single question—if it takes more than 2-3 minutes, move on to maximize attempts.</li>

        <li><strong>Section-Specific Timer:</strong> Each section comes with a fixed time limit. Once the time expires, you will be automatically directed to the next section, with no option to revisit the previous one.</li>

        <li><strong>Type-In-The-Answer (TITA) Questions:</strong> The test includes eight questions where you must type in the correct answer instead of choosing from multiple options. Regular practice of TITA questions can improve accuracy and confidence.</li>

        <li><strong>Sequential Coding Section:</strong> The coding test follows a sequential format, meaning you must complete and submit the first coding problem before proceeding to the second. Once submitted, the first coding problem cannot be edited.</li>

        <li><strong>Practice with Mock Tests:</strong> Taking mock tests is crucial for understanding the exam pattern, improving time management, and reducing test-day stress. Practicing in a simulated environment helps build confidence and enhances problem-solving speed.</li>
    </ul>
